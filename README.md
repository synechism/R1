# DeepSeek R1 implementation

This is my attempt to replicate DeepSeek's R1. The main point of this exercise was to write an MLA immplentation on my own, as well as a GRPO implemntation with minimal dependencies.

If you wanted to actually train a model with this, you'd need a reward model of your choice, but the GRPO logic is fully functioning as is.
